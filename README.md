  Object-oriented Programming / Pharmacy Inventory Management System 
  
The purpose of this assignment is to work with basic object oriented programming in Javascript, in which I made a simple Drug store management system that allow user to enter data about different medicines, and delete- store- and display them. 

The inventory is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the main goal was to practice Object-oriented Programming approach, ES6 Classes, this structure provides a clear, modular codebase. I use it in validating the form, and also to create and render items. I also use inheritance to extend the inventory making it possible to register products in different categories. Data written in the form is stored by using local storage, each with an unique ID/ and delete-button, and I also made filling out the entire form mandatory so that full info set is required to register.

Referances: The resources is used due to work with JavaScript. Mostly things we learned in-and from the documentation of- lectures at school.
